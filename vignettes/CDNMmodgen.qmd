# Introduction

Computational genomic data science is a rapidly changing field.  Biotechnology
and information technology evolve independently.  It is hard to stay on
top of both.  The CDNMmodgen package aims to organize a series of discussions
on important concepts that help control complexity of data management and
analysis in modern genomics.  Topics to be considered are

- self-describing data structures such as SeuratObject, AnnData, SummarizedExperiment,
MultiAssayExperiment
- containerization in the sense of "Docker"
- interactive environments for data exploration
- mixed in- and out-of-memory data representations
- resource consumption measurement
- cloud computing strategies: cloud storage, scalable compute
- language-agnostic methods or principles

This package and discussion series is intended to be a collaborative effort.
Please file issues at the associated [github repo](https://github.com/vjcitn/CDNMmodgen/issues).

The series is also intended to address live problems arising in CDNM.  Please
feel free to propose example problems in the issue tracker.
