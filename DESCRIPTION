Description: This package underlies a series of sessions on
	data and compute strategies for modern genomics at Channing
	Division of Network Medicine.  The sessions will address topics in
	self-describing data structures, mixed in- and out-of-memory
	data representation, containers, resource consumption
	measurement, and cloud computing.  While there will be
	a focus on solutions in R, aspects of python and language-agnostic
	strategies will also be covered.
