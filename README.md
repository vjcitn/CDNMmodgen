# CDNMmodgen

CDNMmodgen is an R package created primarily to house
vignettes for a pkgdown site.

The vignettes underlie a series of discussions 
on computing for modern genomics at Channing Division of Network Medicine

Topics for discussion will include

- self-describing data structures such as SeuratObject, AnnData, SummarizedExperiment,
MultiAssayExperiment
- software package and ecosystem exploration and contribution
- containerization in the sense of "Docker"
- interactive environments for data exploration
- mixed in- and out-of-memory data representations
- resource consumption measurement
- cloud computing strategies: cloud storage, scalable compute
- language-agnostic methods or principles

This package and discussion series is intended to be a collaborative effort.
Please file issues at the associated [github repo](https://github.com/vjcitn/CDNMmodgen/issues).

The series is also intended to address live problems arising in CDNM.  Please
feel free to propose example problems in the issue tracker.
